## Hello Human {#hi}

I'm [Wand](https://github.com/wandersoncferreira), and you've chanced
upon my zettelkasten.  This website contains my working notes
accumulated over some years.

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can
start hopping around by going to the [full index](/posts/).

Have fun!
